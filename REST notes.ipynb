    "What is a web service? \n",
    "- services exposed to the internet for programmatic access, an online API you can call from your code \n",
    "\n",
    "Web service characteristics\n",
    "- an exchange of data that happens over the web: client sends a request, server sends a response \n",
    "- this exchange happens through protocols  \n",
    "\n",
    "Service definition \n",
    "- definition of a service. In Java, to use a class, you'd have to know the name of the class, it's functions, certain definitions to use it. \n",
    "- RESTful Web services have **no** service definition \n",
    "\n",
    "REST is not a web service design, it's an architectural design\n",
    "- The goal is to make a web service as easy for the user\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Hypertext \n",
    "- a structured form of text that has logical links to other texts, known as hyperlinks  \n",
    "\n",
    "Resource Locations \n",
    "-  REST APIs have URLs and addresses similar to websites  \n",
    "    - the practice is to have resource-based addresses \n",
    "    - Resource-based addresses \n",
    "        - contain only the resource, and are independent of the implementation \n",
    "- resource-based URI \n",
    "\n",
    "URI vs URL \n",
    "- URI is a string of characters that identifies an abstract or physical resource \n",
    "- URL is a subset of URIs such that, in addition to identifying a resource, provides a means to locate the resource by describing its primary access mechanism (like http:// )\n",
    "\n",
    "HTTP Methods\n",
    "- GET/PUT/POST/DELETE \n",
    "\n",
    "Metadata \n",
    "- HTTP status code \n",
    "- content type: format of the message. Popular types are XML and JSON  \n",
    "        - the format outputted depends on what the client says they want through content negotiation \n",
    "        \n",
    "Content Negotiation \n",
    "- a negotiation between client and server determining what type the content will be that the client will receive from the server \n",
